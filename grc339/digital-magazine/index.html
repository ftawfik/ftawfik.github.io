                                    Rockefeller was completely self-made and had a combination of ruthless business tactics, strategic brilliance, and a passion for philanthropy, making him a complex individual that any wannabe business person can learn from.

                                    The source of Amazon’s stupefying success is only one of many mysteries — and controversies — surrounding the company that started out selling books online in 1995 and ended 2020 with nearly $400 billion in revenue. The company’s billionaire founder, Jeff Bezos, is prone to bold pronouncements about Amazon’s ambitions and opaque disclosures about where and how the company actually makes money.

                                    Over the last year, our world has been through a lot. From wars to diseases to enjoyment. In times like these we must remember to stay calm and stay together as a society. Our journalists were able to capture these moments on the field. We've created a collection the most powerful photos of the year. These photos are meant to inspire, empower, and motivate individuals for the coming year!

                                <p>
                                    Pablo Escobar had secret passions, according to two DEA agents who hunted the drug lord for months, but only really got to know him after he’d escaped from prison. Agents Steve Murphy and Javier F. Peña learned much about Escobar’s operation in the year and a half they spent searching for him in Colombia in the early 1990s. But personal details about the man himself were elusive.

                                    The Sicilian Mafia was founded in Sicily by elements of the Camorra, a crime organization established in Naples, in the early 1800's. It became established in the United States through the immigration of some of its members in the latter 1800's, the early 1900's, and the mid-1960's and early 1970's.

                                    “It is amazing what Abraham Lincoln did and from where he came.” Those words were spoken by Ron Carley, who appeared in-character (and sometimes stepped out of character) as Abraham Lincoln – clad in period clothing, evoking Lincoln’s famous stovepipe hat, black suit, and bowtie indigenous to the 1860s.

                                    Pizza has a long history. Flatbreads with toppings were consumed by the ancient Egyptians, Romans and Greeks. (The latter ate a version with herbs and oil, similar to today's focaccia.) But the modern birthplace of pizza is southwestern Italy's Campania region, home to the city of Naples.

                                    Relations between the two countries became hostile after the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, which was followed by Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, and due to Russia's backing for the separatist fighters of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic in a war.
