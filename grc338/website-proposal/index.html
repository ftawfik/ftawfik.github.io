                    <p> Welcome to Fomo Fits. Our goal is to create diverse, abstract, and creative designs for clothing that people can relate to. Fomo (Fear of missing out) is an emotion that everyone has inside of them, even if it's miniscule. These articles of clothing will emulate the Fomo expression.   </p>
