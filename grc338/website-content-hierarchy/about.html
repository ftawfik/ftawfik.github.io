            <h2> History </h2>
            
            <p> Fava Truck first started as an idea, until it became a reality. My father, Sherif has a passion for food and cooking. His dream was to open up a business related to the two. One thing let to another and Fava Truck was created. The truck's cuisine combines typical asian, greek, and american cuisines to offer authentic mediterranean food with a twist. </p>
